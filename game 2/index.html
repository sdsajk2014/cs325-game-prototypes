<h2>Forsaken</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The assets are modified by me based on the assets I have.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Realize the interaction between player and other objects
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learn that there are many way to realize funcitonality, I need to keep my mind open to 
avoid unnecessary thinking. For example, to setup a new world bound, i can just add limitation to the movements.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrow game assets from free game assets website.
