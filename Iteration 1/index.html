<h2>Out of Ammos</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The assets are modified by me based on the assets I have.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This prototype is trying to realize the interaction events between objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learnt from this prototype that the scene design can be
very difficult and would take a lot of time;what's more, I learnt that there
exists many bugs in Phaser Arcade Physics System, I will try to use P2 or other 
system next time.
The hardest part in the designing phases is fixing the bugs in phaser about groups collisidition.
